This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a continuation of the React Crash Course of Transversy Media on Youtube. I added by myself some features.

- Working with props and use of Functions in React.
- CSS.
- Basic rendering of the React App (render, ComponentDidMount).
